# Implementation-of-ANA star-algorithm
This code is written to implement the Anytime Non-parametric A* to find an optimal path across obstacles  in the least amount of time. The text files are a variety of maps used to test the algorithm. The "main.py" programs features 4-connectivity in grids and "main_8.py" features 8-connectivity. The 8-connectivity concept finds a more optimal path but is computationally expensive.
